Day 1
We decided to do a wireframe of what the application will look like. We also decided to think of how we wanted the application to function.

Day 2
We began to create our .env. We also made a controller folder and added the Trvl routes to the database.

Day 3
We finished adding all of our routes. Next we tested using postman by creating objects editing objects and deleting objects. We researched beautiful travel places we can post about and write a comment about these places.

Day 4
We are done building crud to the database now we will implement react into our application. We started by making a component folder. We also thought about how to tackle adding authentication. We added a component folder and added users session files into that folder.

Day 5
We did some pier programming CSS Devante led the way with his CSS skills. we spoke about maybe any other changes we would like to add or remove fro our App.
